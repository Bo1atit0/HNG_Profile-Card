              I’m an aspiring front-end developer passionate about creating
              clean, responsive, and user-friendly designs. I enjoy
              experimenting with CSS animations, gradients, and modern UI
              patterns to bring creativity into my projects. Beyond coding, I’m
              also a fashion designer, which influences my sense of design and
              attention to detail.

              My main goal in this program is to become confident in building
              real-world, responsive web applications using HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, and React. I also want to strengthen my
              problem-solving and debugging skills so I can take on freelance
              projects and eventually land a paid internship.

              I sometimes struggle with debugging complex code and fully
              understanding advanced JavaScript logic. I also find backend
              related concepts a bit challenging since my main interest lies in
              frontend development. However, I’m committed to improving through
              consistent practice and mentorship.

              Keep going, even when things feel tough. Remember how far you’ve
              come, from writing your first line of HTML to understanding
              frameworks like React. Stay consistent, keep learning, and don’t
              be afraid to ask for help. You’re building something meaningful,
              one project at a time.

              This journey hasn’t been easy, but it’s been rewarding. I’ve
              learned that progress comes with patience and consistency. I’m
              proud of how much I’ve grown and excited about where this path
              will lead next.
