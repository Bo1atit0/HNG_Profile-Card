          I’m an aspiring front-end developer passionate about creating clean,
          responsive, and user-friendly designs. I enjoy experimenting with CSS
          animations, gradients, and modern UI patterns to bring creativity into
          my projects. Beyond coding, I’m also a fashion designer, which
          influences my sense of design and attention to detail.

          My main goal in this program is to become confident in building
          real-world, responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          and React. I also want to strengthen my problem-solving and debugging
          skills so I can take on freelance projects and eventually land a paid
          internship.

        <section class="about-me" data-testid="test-about-confidence">
          I sometimes struggle with debugging complex code and fully
          understanding advanced JavaScript logic. I also find backend related
          concepts a bit challenging since my main interest lies in frontend
          development. However, I’m committed to improving through consistent
          practice and mentorship.

          Keep going, even when things feel tough. Remember how far you’ve come,
          from writing your first line of HTML to understanding frameworks like
          React. Stay consistent, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to ask for
          help. You’re building something meaningful, one project at a time.

          This journey hasn’t been easy, but it’s been rewarding. I’ve learned
          that progress comes with patience and consistency. I’m proud of how
          much I’ve grown and excited about where this path will lead next.
